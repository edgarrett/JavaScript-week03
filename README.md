# JavaScript-week03
Included are all of the coding questions for this assignment. 
They are numbered. Numbers 5,6,7, 12, & 13 are not done. Search for NOT WORKING to find each.
I don’t understand how to write the solutions from scratch. 
I’m finding similar problems and editing and applying the solutions where I can. 
I’m reading “about what I don’t understand”.
